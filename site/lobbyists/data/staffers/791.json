  "outside_bio": "As a federal lobbyist for BP Worldwide (formerly British Petroleum), Lyons is responsible for interacting with Congressional stakeholders on issues related to BP’s business priorities. But his interest in politics goes all the way back to his childhood when he was listening to the radio waiting for the Orioles to play…According to Lyons, the political science major went to work with U.S. Senator George Allen (R-VA) right after graduating from Randolph-Macon. That was followed by an appointment from President George W. Bush to serve in his administration at the U.S. Small Business Administration. Lyons also served as the energy policy advisor for U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) for nearly three years.",
